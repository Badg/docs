Its purpose is to uncover vulnerabilities and improve system robustness. FIS offers a means to deliberately introduce failures and observe their impacts, helping developers to better equip their systems against actual outages. To read about the FIS service, refer to the dedicated FIS documentation.
Getting started This tutorial is designed for users new to the Fault Injection Simulator and assumes basic knowledge of the AWS CLI and our awslocal wrapper script.</description></item><item><title>Chaos Engineering: Route53 Failover with FIS</title><link>/tutorials/route53-failover-with-fis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/route53-failover-with-fis/</guid><description>Introduction LocalStack allows you to integrate &amp;amp; test Fault Injection Simulator (FIS) with Route53 to automatically divert users to a healthy secondary zone if the primary region fails, ensuring system availability and responsiveness. Route53&amp;rsquo;s health checks and traffic redirection enhance architecture resilience and ensure service continuity during regional outages, crucial for uninterrupted user experiences.
Note Route53 Failover with FIS is currently available as part of the LocalStack Enterprise plan. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to try it out, please contact us to request access.</description></item></channel></rss>
