This service allows you to conduct controlled experiments on your AWS infrastructure, injecting faults and observing how your system responds under various conditions. By using the Fault Injection Service, you can identify weaknesses, test recovery procedures, and ensure that your applications can withstand unexpected disruptions.</description></item><item><title>Chaos Engineering Dashboard</title><link>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/web-application-dashboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/web-application-dashboard/</guid><description>Introduction LocalStack&amp;rsquo;s Chaos Engineering dashboard offers streamlined testing for cloud applications, enabling you to simulate server errors, service outages, regional disruptions, and network latency with ease, ensuring your app is ready for real-world challenges. You can find this Pro feature in the web app by navigating to app.localstack.cloud/chaos-engineering.
Web Application FIS Dashboard LocalStack Web Application provides a dashboard for conducting FIS experiments in user stacks. This control panel offers various FIS experiment options, which includes:</description></item><item><title>Outages Extension</title><link>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/outages-extension/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/outages-extension/</guid><description>Introduction The LocalStack Outages Extension allows you to mimic outages across any AWS region or service. By integrating the Outages Extension using the LocalStack Extension mechanism, you can assess your infrastructure&amp;rsquo;s robustness. Intentionally triggering service outages and monitoring the system&amp;rsquo;s response in situations where the infrastructure is compromised offers a powerful way to test. This strategy helps gauge the effectiveness of the system&amp;rsquo;s deployment procedures and its resilience against infrastructure disruptions, which is a key element of chaos engineering.</description></item><item><title>Special Configurations</title><link>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/special-configs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/chaos-engineering/special-configs/</guid><description>Introduction LocalStack allows users to inject intentional errors, particularly in Kinesis and DynamoDB. You can introduce controlled chaos into your development environment enhance to enhance service resilience. By configuring environment variables, you can simulate disruptions. This simple setup helps improve the response mechanisms of these key AWS services, ensuring robust architecture under challenging conditions with minimal initial configuration.
This guide demonstrates the DYNAMODB_ERROR_PROBABILITY and KINESIS_ERROR_PROBABILITY configuration flags. The guide assumes basic knowledge of the AWS CLI and our awslocal wrapper script.</description></item></channel></rss>
